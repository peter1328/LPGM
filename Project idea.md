# Identifying School Readiness Profiles and their Effects on Development During Schooling: A Systematic/Scoping Review and Simulation Study

Simulation Study:
Vary factors:
N: Continuously (50 - 1000, in steps of 25)
Multilevel-structure (no vs. yes - yes is a typical scenario)
Profiles: 3, 4, 5, 6
Profile linearity: Linear only, moderately non-linear, strongly non-linear
Size of effect on development:
Small, moderate, large (beta = .15, .25, .35)
Entropy:
Low (.60), moderate (.75), high (.90)
= 144 factor level combinations/design cells.
aaand sample sizes: 39. For each combination of these (i.e., cell), draw 5 samples for the start.
this will yield 28080 simulated and then analyzed data sets...
each with 1-8 profiles. This overall yields 224640 analyses. puuuh... :D
We could skip the singlelevel-structure. or reduce the simulated number of profiles between 3 and 5. And linearity to more vs. less linear. And Entropy to low vs. high (.75 vs. .90). And sample sizes from 100 to 1000 in steps of 100? Or randomize the sample size between these two in each data set? Or ...

Minimum specifications:
N between 100 and 1000 in steps of 100, as well as 2000 and 3000?
Number of profiles: 3 vs. 5
Linear vs. non-linear
Entropy low vs. high
Developmental effect low vs. high
All multilevel (check whether modeling or not modeling this affects power or brings bias into selecting the appropriate number of profiles?)
Which work best under which sample size, which sample sizes are necessary under which conditions to find the correct number of profiles and a significant developmental effect.
= 160 combinations * 10 datasets per combination = 1600 simulated datasets, estimate three models per dataset = 4,800 analytic models.
N could also be sampled with sample sizes increasing by 10 and only one draw per condition...
